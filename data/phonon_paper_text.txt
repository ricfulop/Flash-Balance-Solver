The classical Debye model successfully predicts phononic contribution to 
the specific heat of solids in the continuum limit. However, as the phonon 
wavenumber increases, their vibrational density of states gradually deviates 
from the Debye prediction and eventually manifests as Van Hove singularities 
for crystals and a boson peak for glasses. So far, there is still much 
controversy over whether these two non-Debye anomalies are equivalent 
or not. Here we propose a unified model and demonstrate that it describes 
the vibrational density of states in both crystals and glasses. We achieve 
this by treating the vibrational excitation of solids as the elastic phonons 
resonating with local modes. Our modelling enables the construction of 
a phase diagram of non-Debye phonon anomalies. We clarify that the Van 
Hove singularity and boson peak can evolve as two variants of the same entity 
when the dispersion displays continuous softening; otherwise, they emerge 
separately due to resonance-induced extra acoustic softening, further 
proving by their coexistence. The model is supported by a comparison with 
experimental heat capacity data over a wide range of real solids, including 
143 crystalline and glassy substances. These findings provide a unified picture 
of the Van Hove singularity and boson peak, and deepen our fundamental 
understanding of the continuum elasticity of real solids.
In 1912, Peter J. W. Debye developed a model to explain the low- 
temperature heat capacity of crystals. He treats low-frequency phon-
ons as continuum elastic waves and gives the vibrational density of 
states (VDOS) g(ω) as proportional to the squared frequency ω2. How-
ever, the continuum hypothesis fails when decreasing the wavelength 
to the scale of the crystal lattice parameter. Its long-range periodicity 
results in some analytic singularities in g(ω), which is known as the Van 
Hove singularity (VHS)1. When the lattices lose periodicity, a similar 
phonon anomaly, that is, the so-called boson peak (BP), occurs usually 
at lower frequencies, which is widely identified as a rather smooth peak 
if we plot the Debye-normalized g(ω)/ω2 versus ω for glasses and amor-
phous matter2–4 or even high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with chemical 
disorder5. These low-frequency anomalies have a profound influence 
on the low-temperature properties of solids, such as specific heat, 
thermal conductivity and superconductivity. Although the VHS is 
relatively clear, the BP poses a great challenge to the classical Debye 
theory, forcing us to rethink what breaks the continuum limit of pho-
nons in disordered (or real) solids.
Considerable efforts have been spent in the past decades to 
demystify the BP anomaly, generally forming two distinct viewpoints 
in explaining its physical origin. The first school of thought believes 
that the BP in glasses is a variant of the VHS in crystals. Owing to the 
disordered lattices or fluctuating force constants6, the originally sharp 
VHS becomes smoother and moves to lower frequencies. The direct 
evidence is that VHS and BP can be interchangeable by simply tai-
loring the disorder7 or even density8,9. The second viewpoint argues

where Ω(q) and Γ(q) are related to the real and imaginary parts, respec-
tively, of the self-energy function that takes the phonon–phonon inter-
actions into account19,28. Considerable efforts have been spent in the 
past decades to obtain the exact expression for the self-energy function 
by resorting to various methods such as the self-consistent Born 
approximation19,20 and the Taylor expansion29,30,35.
Here we revisit Γ(q) from the perspective of phonon scattering. 
When an extended phonon (elastic wave) interacts with scatterers, its 
propagation becomes damped. This scattering process involves the 
absorption and re-radiation of phonons, mathematically correspond-
ing to the second-order derivative of uλ(t) with respect to t. We, thus, 
obtain the response of the λth scattering wave, ̈uλ(t) = −ω2Gλ(ω)e−iωt, 
with its amplitude

According to the acoustics principles36, the scattering intensity 
Wλ is proportional to the scattering cross-section and the square of 
amplitude, that is,
Wλ ∝πξ2A2

Interestingly, equation (6) resembles that for the scattering of 
electromagnetic waves by bound electrons37 or sound waves by bub-
bles38. By summing Wλ over all phonons (Extended Data Fig. 1), we can 
obtain the total scattering intensity of the system as

where α is a coefficient and Ω0 and ̄Γ  are the system-averaged eigen-
frequency and damping, respectively. For scatterers, ω donates the 
frequency before scattering, so the scattering-free phonons can be 
regarded as ‘external’ linear excitations (ω = cq, where c is the wave 
velocity). Therefore, equation (7) transforms into
Wt = απξ2
q4
(q2

2 + q2θ2
(8)
where q0 = Ω0/c and θ =
̄Γ/c. In reciprocal space, q0 is related to the 
typical scatterer size by q0 = 2π/ξ, and θ is related to the characteris-
tic mean free path of scattering by θ = 2π/ℓ. Obviously, a smaller q0 
corresponds to a larger ξ, whereas a smaller θ indicates a longer ℓ. 
Given that phonon damping directly results from scattering, Γ(q)  
of the system can be approximately proportional to the scattering 
intensity Wt:
Γ(q) ∝Wt = Γ0

where Γ0 = απξ2. In the following, q0, q and θ are each normalized by 
the Debye wavenumber qD = 2π/a, with a being the average atomic 
spacing. We, thus, obtain the dimensionless q0 = a/ξ and θ = a/ℓ. Usu-
ally, both ξ and ℓ are about 1–5 average atomic spacing14,39,40; thus, the 
range of q0 and θ is preliminarily set as 0.2 to 1.
that the BP, completely different from the VHS, originates from some 
local ‘structures’ beyond the lattice, such as soft spots10, orientational 
orders11 and string-like defects12. These defective structures hybrid-
ize with elastic phonons, which produces the quasi-localized modes 
(QLMs) that contribute to the BP13,14. This viewpoint is supported by 
the coexistence of both BP and VHS in strain glasses15, jammed model 
glasses16,17 and two-dimensional triangular lattices18.
These contradictory viewpoints are accompanied by the two dif-
ferent paths of theoretical description of the VDOS of amorphous 
solids. One is the fully harmonic model, for example, the fluctuating 
elasticity theory proposed in refs. 6,19. The solids are treated as elastic 
continua with fluctuating force constants, and the VDOS is obtained 
by solving the fluctuation-corrected Green’s function. The other 
model20, on the contrary, modifies the Green’s function by introducing 
some local modes into extended phonons. Both models numerically 
predict the Rayleigh law of damping coefficient Γ(q) in the low- 
wavenumber (q) region. Considering the power-law decay of local 
stress in space, ref. 21 reveals that Γ(q) instead scales with q as −q4lnq. 
However, the fact is that the BP usually emerges in the high-q region 
where the quadratic damping law holds, which is supported by both 
experiments22–24 and simulations25–27. Furthermore, there is much 
evidence21–23 that the increase in Γ(q) is accompanied by the softening 
of the eigenfrequency Ω(q) of phonons. Recently, refs. 28,29 have 
adopted quadratic Γ(q) damping to predict global softening near the 
(pseudo-)Brillouin zone (PBZ). Using Taylor expansion to higher orders, 
both global and local softening of transverse phonons is successfully 
captured to reproduce the BP and VHS15,30. So far, how to link the pho-
non softening—global or local—to the damping law has not been acces-
sible theoretically, which holds the key to clarify the relationship 
between the BP and VHS. A grand challenge is, therefore, to come up 
with a unifying theory that can weave together the disparate threads 
of observations and findings reported across various materials.
A unified VDOS model
We begin by abstracting an isotropic real solid as a homogeneous con-
tinuum model embedded with some scatterers. The system’s vibrations 
can be treated as the elastic phonons resonating with local modes. There 
are two system-averaged length scales: the typical size ξ of scatterers and 
the characteristic mean free path ℓ (or mobility distance) of the scatter-
ing, jointly modulating the degree of resonance. In terms of the displace-
ment field u, the full dynamics of the system can be described by
M ̈u + H ̇u + Ku = 0
(1)
where M, H and K are the mass matrix, viscous damping matrix and 
stiffness matrix, respectively. Owing to the complexity, equation (1) is 
impossible to solve analytically. Usually in underdamped states, H is 
often assumed to be a linear combination of M and K. If ignoring pho-
non–phonon interactions, these matrices become positive-definite and 
diagonal. Thus, equation (1) can be decomposed into a set of damped 
harmonic phonons:
mλ ̈uλ + ηλ ̇uλ + kλuλ = 0
(2)
where mλ, ηλ and kλ are the mass, viscosity and stiffness, respectively; 
the subscript λ = 1…3N denotes the numbering of phonons. Then, we 
assume that equation (2) has a solution of the form uλ(t) = Gλ(ω)e−iωt, 
where Gλ(ω) is the ω-dependent Green’s (response) function
Gλ(ω) =
1
Ω2
λ −ω2 + iωΓλ
(3)
where Ωλ = √kλ/mλ  and Γλ = ηλ/mλ. This single-degree-of-freedom 
Green’s function can be formally generalized to a three-dimensional 
q-dependent version31–34 as

At the long-wavelength limit (q →0), Γ(q) described by 
equation (9) follows the famous Rayleigh damping law; increasing q 
to q0, equation (9) becomes Γ(q) ∼q2, that is, Mie damping law. This 
theoretical prediction is consistent with experiments22,23,41 and numeri-
cal calculations19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time 
that such a transition of phonon damping has been theoretically pre-
dicted. It is noted that the present Γ(q) ∼q2 law in the high-q region is 
different from diffusive q2 damping, as recently revealed35, and the 
latter results from non-affine motions and occurs far below the Ray-
leigh region. We also compare our model with Γ(q) ∼−q4 ln q reported 
in ref. 21 by fitting the damping data of atomistic-simulated binary 
soft-sphere glasses42. Figure 1a shows that in the low-q region, both 
longitudinal and transverse Γ(q) data can be well fitted by equation (9) 
(red solid lines) and −q4 ln q (blue solid lines). However, in the high-q 
region, the −q4 ln q scaling breaks down, but our model still works. It 
must be pointed out that the deviation of the transverse data from the 
theoretical prediction is due to the sample’s finite-size effects21. This 
deviation disappears for a three-dimensional inverse power-law glass 
of up to 4,000,000 particles43 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Again, our model 
shows better prediction than −q4 ln q scaling, which is further tested 
by fitting the Γ(q) data of NiZr crystalline alloy44 and densified SiO2 
glass45 (Supplementary Fig. 1). These results prove the robustness and 
universality of equation (9).
We next discuss the eigenfrequency Ω(q) under damping Γ(q). 
For a damped-elastic solid, the phonon kinetic energy is propor-
tional to the square of eigenfrequency, that is, Ek(q) ∝Ω2(q). Accord-
ing to the displacement of a damped plane wave46, we can write 
Ek(q) ≈E0(q) exp(−Γ(q)/cqD), where E0(q) ∝Ω2
lattice(q) is the phonon 
kinetic energy of a damping-free crystal. Generally, Ωlattice(q) has a 
sinusoidal form47
Ωlattice(q) = 2cqD
π
sin ( πq
2qD
)
(10)
This formula is derived from the standard result of one-dimensional 
chains, but still works as an approximation for three-dimensional lat-
tices9. Inserting equation (10) into Ek(q), we can derive the expression 
of Ω(q) as
Ω(q)
2cqD/π = sin ( πq
2qD
) exp (−Γ(q)
2cqD
)
(11)
where the sinusoidal term on the right-hand side describes the inher-
ent softening near qD, which is further damped by the exponential term 
(Γ(q) is given by equation (9)). Equation (11) highlights the theoretical 
relationship between the softening and damping of phonons, which 
is supported by existing experimental and numerical evidences21–23. 
Figure 1b presents the perfect agreement between the predicted TA 
dispersion (red solid lines) and the experimental data of Zr46Cu46Al8 
metallic glass measured by using inelastic neutron scattering48, and 
the simulated data of Zr95.5Ni4.5 strain glasses15. Both the sinusoidal-type 
inherent global softening and the local softening can be captured by 
our theoretical model. Previously, only the Taylor expansion to higher 
orders could achieve this prediction30.
On the basis of equation (11), we can further evaluate the phonon 
propagation and damping by calculating the velocity autocorrelation 
function as

where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T  is the temperature (here 
T = 300 K, and the choice of T does not influence the analysis as kBT 
normalization is carried out on C(t)). Figure 1c shows the normalized 
C(t) of the transverse excitation with q = 0.1, q = 0.3 and q = 0.5 when 
q0 = 0.5 and θ = 0.8. Clearly, the long-wavelength phonon (q = 0.1) 
retains its rigid propagation characteristic. Increasing q to 0.5 
(the wavelength is the same size as the scatterer), a noticeable oscilla-
tory decay can be observed. In essence, the shorter the wavelength 
(relative to the scatterer size) of the phonon, the more severe the 
damping and scattering. Besides, all C(t) values can be well fitted by 
exp(−Γ(q)t/2) cos(Ω(q)t)  (solid lines), which is proposed in ref. 21  
and formally consistent with equation (11). It further supports that 
equation (12) effectively describes the propagation and damping of 
phonons with different wavelengths.
The known Γ(q) and Ω(q) allow for a quantitative calculation of 
the VDOS. The VDOS can be extracted from the imaginary part of the 
Green’s function (equation (4)) as

where the subscripts T and L represent the transverse and longitudinal 
branches, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1d, the experimental VDOS 
data of almost the entire frequency spectrum (red solid lines), includ-
ing ambient silica glass7 and FeCoCrNi HEA49, can be well described by 
equation (13). It is noted that the two (transverse and longitudinal) 
peaks in the VDOS of HEA are also captured by our model. For com-
parison, the dashed lines indicate the Debye model that only satisfies 
the low-ω limit. With increasing ω, the Debye model shows an obvious 
deviation from experimental data, but our model does not.
VHS and BP
With the model, we now proceed to reproduce the non-Debye behav-
iours, namely, the BP and VHS. Considering the overwhelmingly dom-
inant contribution of the transverse phonon22,29,50, here we neglect the 
longitudinal one. Besides, ω and Ω(q) are normalized by 2cTqD/π, and 
assume Γ0 = 0.2θ/q2
0  in the calculations. Figure 2a,b illustrates the 
evolution of phonon damping Γ(q), dispersion Ω(q) and the 
Debye-normalized VDOS g(ω)/ω2 by varying q0 for a fixed θ = 0.9. It 
is evident that as q increases, Γ(q) increases monotonically. A smaller 
q0 (larger scatterer) leads to more pronounced damping and softening 
of phonons, which shifts the PBZ boundary towards lower frequencies. 
Additionally, we find that the phonon softening in Ω(q) is always accom-
panied by the deviation in Γ(q) from the Rayleigh law (Extended 
Data Fig. 3). Meanwhile, all the g(ω)/ω2 curves only exhibit a single 
non-Debye excess peak (Fig. 2b). For comparison, the grey dotted line 
shows sinusoidal dispersion without damping (Fig. 2a), corresponding 
to a very sharp VHS peak (Fig. 2b).
Phenomenologically, the BP evolution exhibits a common 
feature8,18,30,50–52: a stronger BP always shifts to a lower frequency, 
whereas the evolution of VHS is exactly the opposite. In Fig. 2b, as q0 
decreases, the peak position monotonically shifts to lower frequencies, 
but the peak height first decreases and then increases. The turning 
point occurs at q0 = 0.5, and the corresponding frequency is near 0.6. 
On the basis of this non-monotonic evolution of peak height, we believe 
that the peaks below ω = 0.6 are more like the BP, and the ones above

ω = 0.6 are more like the VHS. This VHS-to-BP transformation is also 
observed in model glasses by modulating the force-constant 
disorder6,18. When q0 decreases below 0.3, the severe damping causes 
the BP to diverge (the non-Debye excess peak is undefined), implying 
a precursor of the phonon instability3. Our model also captures that 
the Debye levels increase monotonically with decreasing q0 (or disor-
der), which agrees well with experiments and simulations6,8,9,50.
At first glance, the BP anomaly appears to be a relic of the VHS, as 
both exhibit flattening in the dispersion near the PBZ boundary 
(Fig. 2a). To investigate their origins, Fig. 2c,d illustrates the representa-
tive cases of VHS (q0 = 1) and BP (q0 = 0.4) from Fig. 2b, where the 
dispersion is artificially divided into three different segments, namely, 
linear dispersion (orange line), early softening (blue line) and inherent 
softening near the PBZ boundary (purple line). The dotted lines indicate 
their respective contributions to the total VDOS. Figure 2c shows that 
linear dispersion contributes to the Debye level, whereas the inherent 
softening mainly contributes to the VHS (red arrow). Correspondingly, 
phonons are increasingly damped and eventually ill-defined as q 
approaches the PBZ boundary (Extended Data Fig. 4a), indicating the 
Ioffe–Regel limit53.
Figure 2d shows that the situation becomes more complicated for 
the BP case. We find that the peak position is far below the PBZ bound-
ary instead near the early softening segment, but the peak height is 
not solely contributed by the early softening (blue dashed line). The 
smoothed VHS that moves to lower frequencies also provides consider-
able contribution to the peak height. Since the nonlinear softening of 
phonons is continuous and smooth, it is actually impossible to exactly 
distinguish the early softening from the inherent one. In this sense, the 
BP shown in Fig. 2b can be regarded as a broadened VHS that shifts to 
lower frequencies due to early softening. The onset of early softening 
also corresponds to the absence of the propagation characteristic of 
phonons (Extended Data Fig. 4b). On the other hand, it can be also 
understood as follows: a pure BP originates from the early softening, 
but it always receives great contribution from the inherent softening 
(VHS), both together constructing a real BP. It is this dual source of 
origin that gives rise to much controversy about the physics of BP34,54,55. 
Moreover, the Debye level combines contributions not only from the 
linear dispersion but also from the subsequent softening. The notable 
gap between the real Debye level and the ideal one from pure elasticity 
was also observed in an ambient silica glass56.
Our model, in contrast, predicts a different type of vibrational 
behaviour by varying θ and keeping q0 fixed at 0.5 (Fig. 3a). As θ 
decreases (ℓ increases), a scattering resonance peak gradually emerges 
in Γ(q). This type of resonance peak has also been observed in complex 
proteins owing to localized excitations57. All previous models cannot 
explain this phenomenon. Interestingly, this resonance consistently 
induces local softening, even resulting in a ‘negative’ sound velocity—
similar to that in strain glasses15. Such local softening ultimately leads 
to the coexistence of BP and VHS in g(ω)/ω2 (Fig. 3b). We find that the 
stronger the scattering/damping resonance, the more pronounced 
the local softening is and, thus, the coexistence of both BP and VHS is 
more evident. In Fig. 3b, the peak does not monotonically shift from 
the left, because these curves include both continuous and 
non-continuous softening. The real situation is that the VHS peak 
gradually becomes weaker as a shoulder; meanwhile, the BP emerges 
at lower frequencies, which is further clarified in Extended Data Fig. 5.
Figure 3c illustrates a typical case in which both BP and VHS 
coexist. By analysing the contribution of dispersion to the reduced 
VDOS, we find that the positions of BP (blue arrow) and VHS (red 
arrow) are close to peaks of the blue and red dotted curves, respec-
tively. In other words, the BP originates from the first instance of 
local softening (blue solid segment), whereas the VHS arises from the 
global softening near the PBZ boundary (red solid segment). They are 
separated by the secondary hardening (purple solid segment). In this

case, they belong to two different identities, with very weak interac-
tion between them. Near the BP position, the propagation feature 
of phonons is gradually lost (Extended Data Fig. 4c). However, fur-
ther increasing q to the range between the BP and VHS, phonon-like 
excitations begin to partially recover. In this case, the Ioffe–Regel 
limit occurs near the VHS rather than the BP, which contradicts the 
model that predicts a close relationship between the BP frequency 
and Ioffe–Regel limit58. It suggests that their non-coincidence is 
possible, a finding that has been experimentally validated44. The 
BP–VHS coexistence demonstrates that the phonon Green’s function 
framework that successfully explains the BP24,25,27,42 can be extended 
to describe both BP and VHS simultaneously.
Phase diagram of non-Debye phonon anomalies
Here we systematically analyse the evolution of non-Debye phonon 
anomalies by varying q0 and θ. The two physical quantities, represent-
ing the average size of scatterers and their characteristic mean free 
path of scattering, together constitute the parameter space over 
which different anomaly scenarios take control in different regions 
of the ‘phase diagram’. By defining the excess peak IND as the maximum 
of Debye-normalized VDOS and plotting their two-dimensional con-
tour surface in the q0–θ space, we obtain the phase diagram of 
non-Debye vibrational anomalies (Fig. 4a). This diagram reveals three 
distinct regions: single VHS, single BP and their coexistence. The 
orange solid line, corresponding to the valley of the contour, marks 
the BP–VHS boundary. In the BP region, IND increases as q0 decreases 
(indicating increased scattering), whereas the opposite trend is 
observed in the VHS region.
The coexistence region is represented by a small area at the bottom 
left, surrounded by black squares. As mentioned above, the coexistence 
of BP and VHS is always accompanied by the appearance of a resonance 
peak. According to the necessary condition for a peak in equation (9) 
(Methods), we obtain the non-zero real root as
q∗=
√2q2
0
√2q2
0 −θ2
(14)
It is interesting to find that the boundary data (black squares) of 
the coexistence region can be accurately fitted by equation (14), only 
when q∗= 0.73 (pink dashed line). When the value of q∗ is either too 
large or too small, the predicted coexistence region will be either 
overestimated or underestimated (Extended Data Fig. 6a). If the peak 
position is greater than 0.73 (Extended Data Fig. 6b), the local softening 
is close to the boundary of PBZ (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Therefore, two 
phonon anomalies overlap, resulting in the only one peak in g(ω)/ω2 
(Extended Data Fig. 6d).
The results above indicate that two necessary conditions must be 
met for the coexistence of BP and VHS. The first is the presence of a 
resonant peak, and the second is that the peak position must be well 
below a threshold. To satisfy these criteria, the solid system requires 
q0 ≤0.67 and θ ≤0.4 (or ξ ≥1.5a and ℓ≥2.5a). In other words, both 
large scatterer size and relatively long mean free path of scattering are 
necessary. These two inequalities are seemingly contradictory. This is 
why such coexistence has rarely been observed in experiments16. So 
far, it has primarily been observed in specific situations, such as strain 
glasses with glass/nanodomains15, defective HEAs with interstitials/
lattice distortions5 and some model glasses59. In these solids, the 
extended phonons resonate strongly with local modes in a frequency 
range far below the PBZ boundary.
Furthermore, our predicted VDOS can be used to gauge the heat 
capacity Cp. In general, the total Cp of solids comes from the electronic 
γT and phononic Cph contributions, that is,
Cp = γT + Cph
(15)
where the Sommerfeld coefficient γ is determined using a standard 
procedure40,52,60. According to the phonon heat capacity theory, the 
Cph value can be calculated from the VDOS as
Cph = 3R∫
ωD
0
( ℏω
kBT)
2
eℏω/kBT
(eℏω/kBT −1)
2 g(ω)dω
(16)
where R is the gas constant, ωD denotes the maximum (Debye) fre-
quency and ℏ is the reduced Planck constant. In general, an excess 
non-Debye peak is also present in the Cph/T3 plot, with its height defined 
as HND = [Cph/T3]TND, where TND denotes the peak position.
Figure 4b presents the phase diagram of non-Debye heat capacity 
anomalies corresponding to the data in Fig. 4a. In the calculations, the 
q0-dependent cut-off frequency is set to ωD = 21.23 + 20.03q0 THz. 
Compared with Fig. 4a, the heat capacity phase diagram shows two key 
differences. First, the two-phase region disappears. Second, HND 
increases monotonically as q0 decreases but is less influenced by θ 
(Extended Data Fig. 7). This suggests that the integration process in 
equation (16) obscures some of the finer details of the excess vibra-
tional peaks, which aligns with data from strain glasses15 and HEAs5. 
This explains why only a single excess peak is observed in the experi-
mental Cph/T3 plots of real solids40,54,61. In addition to the excess peak 
of low-temperature Cph, the present theory can capture the anomalous 
plateau of thermal conductivity in glasses62,63 (Supplementary Text 
and Supplementary Fig. 2).

Low-temperature heat capacity of real solids
To unravel such universality of HND, we measured the heat capacity of 
a wide variety of solids. Details of the sample preparation, characteri-
zation and measurement are provided in the Methods and Extended 
Data Fig. 8. Extended Data Fig. 9 displays the heat capacity Cp and Cph/T3 
of eight representative solids after subtracting the electronic contribu-
tion (Extended Data Fig. 10). As expected, Cp and Cph/T3 can be 
described satisfactorily by our present theory (black dashed lines), 
with the fitting parameters listed in Supplementary Table 3.
Figure 5 displays the experimental HND values and their reciprocal 
positions 1/TND, including 55 data points measured in this study, along 
with 88 data points from other solids found in the literature 
(Supplementary Table 4). These solids span a wide range of chemical 
components, structures and bondings, leading to large variations in 
both HND and TND in the plot of Cph/T3. Remarkably, most of the data 
points collapse well onto a master curve, which cannot be explained by 
any previous theory. Interestingly, our model offers a reliable mechanism 
to account for this universality (red solid curve). In the fitting, we selected 
the optimal θ = 0.628 and varied q0 from 0.31 to 1. In particular, any value 
of θ between 0.4 and 0.8 would not make much of a difference as the 
evolution of HND is insensitive to θ (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7). 
However, the data points of ambient (un-densified) silica glasses do not 
conform to this general trend, although their VDOS and boson heat 
capacity peak can be described by our model (Fig. 1d and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). We believe that this discrepancy results from the unique 
rotation of corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra in ambient silica glasses2. 
Such motions contribute to the floppy modes that are crucial for 
describing the BP anomaly in silica glasses64,65. Note that on densification, 
the silica glass data become normal, with the peak height being weaker 
and the position moving to a higher temperature. The reason is that 
densification can effectively reduce the corner-sharing tetrahedra, as 
revealed in a recent simulation study66. The data point for silica crystal 
is close to the model-predicted trend as well.
Near the top right corner, where q0 is approximately 0.31, the 
associated solids are typically polymer glasses, which exhibit the high-
est peak of HND = 309.6 μJ mol−1 K−4. Correspondingly, the calculated 
average size of scatterers approaches 3–4 atomic spacings (approxi-
mately 1 nm), possibly referring to the molecular chains of polymers. 
In the bottom-left corner, where q0 approaches 1, the scatterer size 
aligns with atomic spacing. In particular, many ordered crystals, such 
as Al3Sc intermetallics, single-crystal Si and HEAs, are situated in this 
place. These solids demonstrate the highest TND ≈50 K, but with very 
weak HND ≈20 μJ mol−1 K−4.
Solids with complex structures, such as metallic glasses and their 
composites, occupy the intermediate portion of the plot. The calcu-
lated average size of scatterers is 2–3 atomic spacings, which indicates 
short- to medium-range orders39 or interphase interfaces. Nevertheless, 
the phonon scattering is rather complex, not only dependent on topo-
logical defects but also on the surrounding elastic matrix and the 
defect–matrix interaction. It must be pointed out that both q0 and θ 
are defined from the perspective of atomic vibrations instead of static 
structures. Our model does not specify the structural origin for phonon 
scattering. As such, 143 real solids, regardless of chemical components 
and topological structures, can be modelled as the scatterer–contin-
uum system but with different damping effects. The universal evolution 
of non-Debye phonon anomalies is quantitatively described by our 
theory. For a given solid, the exact correlation between phonon scat-
tering and structural features is an interesting topic, which would 
require in-depth atomistic understanding but is beyond the scope of 
this study.
Conclusions
We developed a VDOS model universal for solids, either amorphous 
materials or ordered crystals, to settle the long-standing controversy 
about the BP and VHS. Our model derives a phonon damping func-
tion that not only describes the low-q Rayleigh scattering but also 
captures the deviation at higher q. This damping directly contributes 
to an extra softening of phonons in dispersion beyond the inherent 
softening near the PBZ boundary. In competition between phonon 
propagation and damping, the model predicts a panoramic ‘phase 
diagram’ of non-Debye phonon anomalies: BP and VHS. We demonstrate 
that the continuous softening of phonons induces either single BP or 
single VHS. The VHS mainly arises from phonon softening near the 
Brillouin zone boundary, leading to a piling-up of the VDOS. The BP 
comes from a combined contribution from both extra and inherent 
softening. Accompanied by the occurrence of BP or VHS, the damping 
deviates from Rayleigh scattering, and the acoustic behaviour is lost. 
In this sense, the BP can be regarded as a broadened version of the 
VHS that moves to low frequencies owing to extra softening. When 
the phonon damping/scattering exhibits a resonance peak, the extra 
softening in dispersion becomes highly localized and, thus, separates 
from the inherently global softening. In this scenario, the coexistence 
of BP and VHS emerges, demonstrating that they are fundamentally 
distinct phenomena. Our model is validated by experimental data on 
low-temperature heat capacity of 143 real solids.

Methods
Sample preparation
Various types of material that cover metallic glasses and their poly-
crystalline products, metallic glass composites, single-phase 
face-centred-cubic or body-centred-cubic HEA, two-phase (face- 
centred-cubic + body-centred-cubic) HEA, high-entropy metallic 
glasses and high-entropy metallic glass composites are prepared. All 
metallic glasses, metallic glass composites ((Zr75Ti15Nb10)100–y(Be50 
Cu27.5Ni22.5)y with y = 0, 8, 14, 20, 25, 28, 29, 30 and 32), single-phase 
face-centred-cubic HEAs ((Fe25Co25Cr25Ni25)100–xAlx with x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 
and 7) and body-centred-cubic HEAs (Nb25Ti25V25Mo25 and Nb20Ti20V20 
Mo20Ta20), and a high-entropy metallic glass (Zr20Ti20Hf20Cu20Be20) are 
prepared by arc melting and suctioned into water-cooled copper moulds 
under an argon atmosphere. A two-phase HEA and a high-entropy metal-
lic glass composite can be obtained by annealing the as-cast high-entropy 
metallic glass at 670 K and 880 K for 60 min, respectively.
Property characterization
The structure of the prepared samples was confirmed by XRD with Cu 
Kα radiation and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy 
(JEM-2100F, JEOL, operated at 200 keV), and the detailed information 
of some solids is provided in Extended Data Fig. 8. The specific heat 
capacity was measured under high-vacuum conditions with a Quantum 
Design physical property measurement system, which allows cooling 
down to 1.9 K with a liquid-helium system.
Solving the boundary condition of BP–VHS coexistence
The coexistence of BP and VHS is accompanied by the appearance of a 
resonant peak of phonon damping Γ (q) with its slope being zero. Math-
ematically, this corresponds to the first-order derivative of Γ (q) with 
respect to q being zero:
Γ ′(q) =
2Γ0q3 [2q2q2
0 −2q4
0 −q2θ2]
[(q2
0 −q2)
2
+ q2θ2]
2
= 0
(17)
The non-zero real root of equation (17) is easily solved as 
equation (14).
